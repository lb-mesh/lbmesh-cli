# LB Mesh Projects

Thank you for using LB Mesh. 

## Getting Started

In the **database** folder, you will find folder called **lbmesh-mongo-schema**.

Change Directory into this folder, run **npm install** and **node index**

This will generate the schema for the default **lbmesh** database the full stack is expecting.

Feel free to change the database name as needed ( update your pm2 and docker-compose files too)
